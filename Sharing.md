# Sharing
Source material starts [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-give-access-new-workspaces). Recommendation is to read through several sub-items in the MS Documentation.

## [Sharing Reports & Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003635#:~:text=To%20let%20your%20coworkers%20share,to%20others%20in%20your%20organization)

- Sharing in an ad hoc fashion, you CAN: allow recipients to re-share reports, Grant recipients access to underlying data set, and send email notifications
- You CANNOT: choose whether to allow recipients to make copies of the report (only an option when distributing via an app), whether to allow exporting of data (this set in the report settings or at a tenant level), or whether users are allowed to personalize visuals (this is enabled by default, but can also be set at an individual report or tenant level)
