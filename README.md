## How to Use this Document
We recommend the Microsoft Learn track first. Find it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/data-analyst-associate/). This is the go-to source for all material covered by the exam. Use the outline below as your guide, checking off as you go.

We then recommend working with the provided material to solidify what's been learned. **There is too much material for everything to sink in just following the Microsoft Learn path.** You will have to practice.
