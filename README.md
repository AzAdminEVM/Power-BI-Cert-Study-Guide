# Power-BI-Cert-Study-Guide
A study guide for the PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Certification Exam

# Introduction
This repo contains a study guide for the [PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst certification exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/da-100), the exam to certify the recipient as a [Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/data-analyst-associate/).

# What this document contains

First and foremost is the current Skills Measured outline found [here](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4qbu6). This has been recreated below as a checklist first, and then as an outline with links to each section from 1) the primary Microsoft Learn page(s), 2) additional Microsoft documentation, and 3) additional resources.

The document also contains references to further reading and resources, including tutorial videos, paid training (not ours), and the Dashboard in a Day offered by Microsoft (free).

**This document is current as of February 2022.**

# How to Use this Document
We recommend the Microsoft Learn track first. Find it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/data-analyst-associate/). This is the go-to source for all material covered by the exam. Use the outline below as your guide, checking off as you go.

We then recommend working with the provided material to solidify what's been learned. **There is too much material for everything to sink in just following the Microsoft Learn path.** You will have to practice.
