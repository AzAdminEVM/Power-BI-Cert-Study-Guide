# Power-BI-PL-300-Study-Guide
A study guide for the PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Certification Exam

# Introduction
The below is a study guide for the [PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst certification exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/da-100), the exam to certify the recipient as a [Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/data-analyst-associate/).

`The study guide and outline are current as of February 2022.`

# What this Document Contains
This document provides a checklist recreation of the Microsoft's current Skills Measured outline found [here](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4qbu6). It is structured as follows:

## Section Header
#### Section Sub-Header
- Sub-section

Headers and sub-headers always link to the official Microsoft Learn path documentation (where it exists), while sub-sections link mostly to other Microsoft Documentation. In instances where MS Documentation is lacking, outside resources are used or the MS Learn page specific to the topic is linked. Additional resources are then added at the bottom of each section linking out to MS Learn labs and third-party resources. 

The document also contains references to [further reading and resources](#additional-resources--links), including tutorial videos, paid training (not ours), and the Dashboard in a Day project offered by Microsoft (free).

Lastly, the repo contains additional pages with more granular information on specific topics. These largely represent gaps the creator found in his own knowledge following one go-through of the MS Learn material. Use these as supplement, but do not treat them as comprehensive for their specific topic.

# How to Use this Document
Clone the repo. Then, begin with the Microsoft Learn track found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/data-analyst-associate/). It is the go-to source for all material covered by the exam. Use the outline's checkboxes to track progress and the links to return to sections in the future. 

To check off the sub-sections and headers, add an `x` between the brackets like so `[x]`. Example:
- [ ] Incomplete
- [x] Complete

We then recommend working with the supplemental material to solidify content. 

**NOTICE: Following the Microsoft Learn path is not enough. There is too much material to memorize in one go and content will not sink in without further practice and review. You *will* have to practice, and you will be revisiting content.**

# Additional Notes & Caveats
Unfortunately, Microsoft's Learn path and its outline are not a 1:1. This can manifest in several ways.

First, a sub-section in the outline may not have its own explicit page in the MS Learn path and may exist across several pages of content. E.g. `identify and connect to a data source` does not exist as a specific page in the MS Learn section for `Prepare the Data`, but rather as several pages tied to various data sources.  

Second, content for certain sub-sections in the outline may not be found within the indicated MS Learn section. We have tried to note this where possible.

Lastly, a section titled `Develop a data model` exists in the Outline, but has no corollary in the MS Learn track. In this case, informative content has been provided to the best of our ability. Several gaps surely remain, however, so please feel free to contribute.

# Resources for Colleagues (AzTech International)
