# [Scatter, Bubble, & Dot Chart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-scatter)
All contained in the same visualization. What changes is only how it's configured in the Visualization pane.

These are used to compare two `numeric` values on the X & Y axes, along with a third in the bubble size.

Available Fields:
- Details: tell Power BI how to group the values
- Legend: tell PBI to separate values by category, with one color per category
- X Axis
- Y Axis
- Size: Bubble size (turns it into a bubble chart, rather than a scatter)
- Play: Turns the visual playable

Turn it into a Dot Chart by adding a numeric field to the X Axis rather than a categorical one.

##### Miscellaneous
- Can change shape of the bubbles, down to the specific category
